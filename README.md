# Eat My UMass

Rename the above with the name of your application.

# Overview

Our application allows UMass students to log-in with their student ID and use their campus meal plans (or UCard debit) to purchase food from on-campus locations and have it delivered to an on-campus address. Craving Sweets when you're cramming in the library at 11pm on a Tuesday? Hungry for Tamales but don't want to slip on the ice on Orchard Hill? For a busy college student, taking time out of their day to go get food (especially when it's snowy or it's UMass Plague Season) can be a hassle. Our goal is to help students save time and money, and keep UMass Dining #1!

Our log-in feature, connected to the UMass Web Portal, allows students to access their campus meal plans and debit accounts to easily pay for their delivery. Deliveries can be made to any on-campus location, from the 23rd floor of DuBois to the basement of Van Meter. Location hours and menus are available, and the interactive menu allows users to easily add items to their carts. 
Deliver food from anywhere on campus to dorms for students (dining halls, blue wall, etc)

# Application Initialization

To use this application you should have `node` and `npm` installed and issue the following commands:

1. `npm install`: this will install the required `node` libraries.
2. `npm run watch`: this will compile the application code and produce an `App.js` file in the `static` directory. This command will also continue to run until explicitly killed (e.g., control-C).
3. `npm start`: this will run the Express server, `server.js`, allowing you to view the running application in the browser window.
