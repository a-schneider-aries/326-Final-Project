FOR GIT:

to commit, you have to run this command:
git commit -m "<>"
        where <> is the name of your commit (like the changes you've done)
then you can run git push or git pull

so the order is:

make edit
git add .
git commit -m "name of edit"
git push

and then others must git pull

FOR MONGO
run mongod.exe
then type mongo into the terminal
